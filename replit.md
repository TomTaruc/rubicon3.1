# Drawing Application

## Overview
This is a Java Swing-based drawing application that allows users to create shapes (lines, rectangles, ellipses) with mouse interactions. The application features undo/redo functionality and shape management capabilities.

## Recent Changes (September 12, 2025)
Fixed all critical functionality issues with UI interactions and drawing preview:

### Issues Resolved
1. **Undo/Redo Single-Click Fix**: Undo (Ctrl+Z) and Redo (Ctrl+Shift+Z) now work on first press
2. **Real-Time Drawing Preview**: Shapes now show while drawing/dragging, not just when finished
3. **Button State Management**: Undo/redo buttons properly disable when no actions are available
4. **Clear All Functionality**: Fixed non-functional clear all button

### Technical Fixes Applied
- **Drawing Preview**: Implemented proper Swing preview system in DrawingView with setPreviewShape/clearPreviewShape methods
- **Mouse Events**: Updated DrawingController to use repaint-based rendering instead of direct graphics
- **Focus Management**: Enhanced keyboard shortcut handling with proper focus management
- **UI State Updates**: Improved undo/redo timing with SwingUtilities.invokeLater for immediate response
- **ActionController**: Fixed undo/redo methods to use actual command service instead of placeholders
- **Clear All**: Added @Override annotation to clearAll() method in DrawingAppService

## Project Architecture
- **Root Module**: `rubicon` - Multi-module Maven project
- **Core Module**: `drawfx` - Contains shared interfaces and command pattern implementation
- **GUI Module**: `draw` - Contains Swing UI components and application logic

### Key Components
- `CommandService`: Manages undo/redo stacks using command pattern
- `ActionController`: Handles UI actions and maintains button states
- `DrawingAppService`: Core application service for drawing operations
- `DeawingCommandAppService`: Command wrapper service with undo/redo capabilities

## Build & Run
- Java 17 required
- Maven build system
- Run via: `cd draw && mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.gabriel.draw.Main"`
- Configured as VNC application for GUI display in Replit environment

## Current Status
✅ Application running successfully
✅ All user interface issues resolved
✅ Undo/redo working with single clicks (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z)
✅ Real-time drawing preview while dragging shapes
✅ Clear all functionality operational
✅ Proper focus management for keyboard shortcuts
