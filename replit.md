# Drawing Application

## Overview
This is a Java Swing-based drawing application that allows users to create shapes (lines, rectangles, ellipses) with mouse interactions. The application features undo/redo functionality and shape management capabilities.

## Recent Changes (October 2, 2025)
Successfully set up for Replit environment:

### Setup Completed
1. **Java Environment**: Installed Java (GraalVM) for project
2. **Maven Build**: Fixed compilation issues by adding missing CLEAR_ALL constant to ActionCommand
3. **Dependencies**: Removed duplicate dependency in draw/pom.xml
4. **Build System**: Successfully built all modules (rubicon, drawfx, draw)
5. **Workflow Configuration**: Configured VNC workflow to run the GUI application
6. **Git Ignore**: Verified comprehensive .gitignore for Java/Maven projects

### Technical Fixes Applied
- Added `CLEAR_ALL` constant to `drawfx/src/main/java/com/gabriel/drawfx/ActionCommand.java`
- Removed duplicate `drawfx` dependency from `draw/pom.xml`
- Configured workflow with VNC output for GUI display

## Project Architecture
- **Root Module**: `rubicon` - Multi-module Maven project
- **Core Module**: `drawfx` - Contains shared interfaces and command pattern implementation
- **GUI Module**: `draw` - Contains Swing UI components and application logic

### Key Components
- `CommandService`: Manages undo/redo stacks using command pattern
- `ActionController`: Handles UI actions and maintains button states
- `DrawingAppService`: Core application service for drawing operations
- `DeawingCommandAppService`: Command wrapper service with undo/redo capabilities
- `DrawingView`: Main drawing canvas with real-time preview
- `DrawingToolBar`: Toolbar with shape tools and actions
- `DrawingMenuBar`: Menu bar with file and edit operations

## Build & Run
- **Java Version**: Java 17 (GraalVM)
- **Build System**: Maven multi-module project
- **Run Command**: `cd draw && mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.gabriel.draw.Main"`
- **Output**: VNC application for GUI display in Replit environment

## Current Status
✅ Application successfully imported to Replit
✅ All dependencies resolved
✅ Maven build successful (all 3 modules)
✅ Workflow configured with VNC output
✅ .gitignore properly configured for Java/Maven projects
✅ Ready to use in Replit environment
