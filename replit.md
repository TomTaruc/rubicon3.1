# Drawing Application

## Overview
This is a Java Swing-based drawing application that allows users to create shapes (lines, rectangles, ellipses) with mouse interactions. The application features undo/redo functionality and shape management capabilities.

## Recent Changes (September 12, 2025)
Fixed critical functionality issues with undo/redo and clear all buttons:

### Issues Resolved
1. **Undo/Redo Double-Click Issue**: Fixed buttons requiring multiple clicks before responding
2. **Button State Management**: Undo/redo buttons now properly disable when no actions are available
3. **Clear All Functionality**: Fixed non-functional clear all button

### Technical Fixes Applied
- Updated ActionController.canUndo()/canRedo() methods to use actual command service instead of placeholders
- Added clearAll() method to AppService interface and implemented in DeawingCommandAppService
- Fixed clear all action to properly clear shapes after user confirmation

## Project Architecture
- **Root Module**: `rubicon` - Multi-module Maven project
- **Core Module**: `drawfx` - Contains shared interfaces and command pattern implementation
- **GUI Module**: `draw` - Contains Swing UI components and application logic

### Key Components
- `CommandService`: Manages undo/redo stacks using command pattern
- `ActionController`: Handles UI actions and maintains button states
- `DrawingAppService`: Core application service for drawing operations
- `DeawingCommandAppService`: Command wrapper service with undo/redo capabilities

## Build & Run
- Java 17 required
- Maven build system
- Run via: `cd draw && mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.gabriel.draw.Main"`
- Configured as VNC application for GUI display in Replit environment

## Current Status
✅ Application running successfully
✅ All user interface issues resolved
✅ Undo/redo working with single clicks
✅ Clear all functionality operational
